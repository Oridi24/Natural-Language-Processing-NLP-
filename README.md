# *Sentiment Analysis with NLP: End-to-End Pipeline*

### *¬øWhat is NLP?*
*Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. It focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP powers a wide range of applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.*

---
*This repository presents a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline focused on sentiment analysis, covering all the core stages of a classic NLP and including Machine Learning techniques to classify gourmet product reviews into two categories: positive reviews (1) and negative reviews (0).*


## üìå *Project Objectives* 
1. ***Download and Explore the Corpus***:
   - *Vocabulary size and distribution*
   - *Distribution of reviews by rating*
   - *Count of positive vs negative reviews*
   - *Most frequent n-grams*
   - *Word clouds*
   - *Word embeddings visualization with Word2Vec*
   - *Conclusions and insights from data exploration*

2. ***Text Preprocessing***:
   - *Development of a modular preprocessing function in Python.*
   - *Typical steps: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization, etc.*
   - *Designed for reusability and clarity*

3. ***Model Training and Evaluation***:
    -*Binary sentiment classification (positive vs negative)*
   - *2 different types of vectorization (`CountVectorizer`,  `TF-IDF`).*
   - *Training of 4 different models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).*
   - *Evaluation based on metrics: precision, recall, F1-score.*
   - *Analysis of class balance and vectorizer configuration*

4. ***Final Report***:
   - *Metric comparison and final model selection*
   - *Strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the approach*
   - *Suggestions for future improvements*
